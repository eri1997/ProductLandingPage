            <p>
              Alone against an army, Yasuo chose to stand and fight. He blocked
              a narrow pass between two mountains, allowing innocents to escape
              the bloodshed.Wielding the truth of steel as a dance, he felled
              countless foes-- but even he could not hold out forever. The
              Dragon of Truth, moved by his swordsmanship, came down from its
              peak to bless him.

            <p>
              Long ago, two brothers fought a bitter war across Ionia. Yone, the
              older brother, was a warlord renowned for his adherence to honor
              and duty. He fought to defend the country against those who would
              break its rites and rituals - until he was forced to confront his
              own brother for his crimes. Both were fated to fall in their final
              duel… a lesson, perhaps, in pride and hubris.

              Yasuo never wanted to be a space pirate… until he was framed for
              his brother's murder, and had to flee his life of relative luxury.
              Now on the run from a dozen different military and paramilitary
              factions, he's putting together an eccentric crew to make a new
              life among the stars.
